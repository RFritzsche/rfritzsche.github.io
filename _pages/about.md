Hi, I'm Rosa (she/her). I am a PhD-candidate in the graduate programme ["Interaction of Grammatical Building Blocks (IGRA)"](https://www.philol.uni-leipzig.de/graduiertenkolleg-interaktion-grammatischer-bausteine/) at the University of Leipzig.

My research mainly focuses on theoretical syntax. More specifically, my interests include: Anti-locality and anti-local agreement; locality and cyclicity; sequential interactions of syntactic operations and constraints; and syntactic microvariation. I have also worked on mutual counterfeeding in Bari (Eastern Nilotic) tonal phonology.
