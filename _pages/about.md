I am a second-year PhD-candidate in the graduate programme "Interaction of Grammatical Building Blocks (IGRA)" at the University of Leipzig. My pronouns are he/him.

I am mainly interested in syntax and the syntax-morphology interface but sometimes also in phonology. More specifically:

- (Non-canonical) Agreement
- Syntactic microvariation
- Interactions between movement and agreement
- Welsh Syntax
- Tone
